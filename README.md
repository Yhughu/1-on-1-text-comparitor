# 1-on-1-text-comparitor
This is a Python script, used to compare 2 texts to see how much alike they are.
To use this script, you need to have 2 docx files, one that ends with P and one with the same name, but ends with N.
Then you can use the 5 functions inside the script to calculate certain text comparison metrics on these files.
